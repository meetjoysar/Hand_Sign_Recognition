# Hand_Sign_Recognition
This project was a collaborative effort among myself and three friends during our third semester at our college.

This project serves as a basic showcase of the exceptional accuracy achieved by utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for computer vision tasks. It demonstrates the successful development of a finger spelling sign language translator with an impressive accuracy rate of 95%.

By constructing the appropriate dataset and training the KNN model, the project can be expanded to encompass other sign languages. It should be noted that sign languages are typically expressed in a contextual manner rather than solely relying on finger spelling. Consequently, this project addresses a specific subset of the larger challenge of sign language translation.

## Steps To Run Sign-To-Speech Translator

1.	Click or open index.html and allow your webcam device when asked about permission.

2.	After arriving the Start-Stop gesture training page, train your start gesture (i.e., after this gesture model will start predicting the sign) and stop gesture (basically training your idle position to know the end of sign and moving forward to next sign) (Train minimum 30 samples each for Start and Stop)

3.	Next you proceed to actual training data set page where you train all your sign (may it be ASL, ISL or any custom sign too). Here, too for each sign you would like train it requires minimum 30 examples. 

4.	Doing so, then you can click Translate button to execute the sign translation process. 

5.	Now, using your Start sign you can start to communicate in sign language. At end of each word the word will be pronounced in audio format too.

6.	Thus, you have a fully functional sign to speech web-application which further can be even used while a video call, etc.
